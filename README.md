# Walk Disney 

Walk Disney is a Disney World vacation planning app. Users are able to create an account and choose activites, dining, and lodging from different parks and add them to their itinerary. Our team members either had never been to Disney or hadn't been since they were kids, so our goal was to take some of the stress out of planning a Disney trip by putting most of the information in one place. 

Create an account and make your itinerary at [Walk Disney - link coming soon](#).

## Main Features

* Users can create an account and build an itinerary for four different parks at Disney World. 
* Activities, Dining, and Lodging can both be added and deleted from the itinerary. 
* Dining, lodging, and activities include helpful information such as websites, descriptions, times, and price range.

## Future Goals

Given more time, our group would've liked to expand on the 'game' portion of our app. Currently, there is a 10% chance for a Disney character to pop up on each page. Our goal is for those characters to turn into badges that a user can collect for points. Another stretch goal is to give the user more flexibility with their itineraries, such as moving activities around. We would also like to expand on the amount of activites, lodging, and dining options that are currently in the database.
